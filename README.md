# QuizBuzzer
I built a quiz show style buzzer for my kids and our National Bible Bee group to practice our trivia.  The heart of the system is an Arduino Nano connected to 5 5V arcade buttons (one for each of 4 players and a master reset button).  There is also a passive buzzer to make sound when a button is pressed.  I will try to add images here in the future.  

Future additions would be a louder buzzer speaker and I have MOSFETs to add LED light strips to flash when a player hits the button.
